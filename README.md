A game where you should guess the number that stored into a mystery ball. Your opponent is a mighty computer.

This project was the second app writen by myself. It helped me to understand an AVAudioplayer and textField delegate methods a little further.
At some moment - the project was refactored to exclude a storyboard UI design. All UI is writen by code since then, but i saved my first project realisation into a separate branch, called ui_by_storyboard(before_refactoring).

Unfornutanely - the audio player causing a memory leak, that i can't fix.
